# github_bloc_one

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

First of all, we have two main builds in our lib folder. These are the view and core structures.

**- core: This layer is the part that will manage or start the work that will do our main job**

* **components:** This layer contains widgets that we can use on pages, such as buttons, text, which we can create here and customize with parameters wherever we want to use them.

* **constants:** We keep some variables that we will use in the project in this structure. For example, various color palettes.

* **extensions:** This layer gives us some convenience. We have made the paths of our images ready for use with a simple extension here.

**-view: This layer contains our pages. We can create a folder for each screen.**
